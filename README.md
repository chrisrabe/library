# Library
A book management application created for Infoxchange's full stack coding challenge. The project is
implemented using the MERN stack. MongoDB is used as the app's storage component, Express and NodeJS
used to implement the backend component, and React is used to implement the front-end component.

# Getting Started
## Setting up local backend
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Run the `start-dbs.sh` script to create MongoDB container
3. Run `npm start` to start local server
